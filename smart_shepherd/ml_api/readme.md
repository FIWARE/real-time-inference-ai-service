# ML API as a service

The ML model is deployed via REST API to be consumed for real-time inference. 
The implementation of the ML API relies on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

FastAPI is a modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
